    <p class="document">Initially I wanted to create some sort of radical icicle plot but I quickly found that to be too
        difficult to achieve using D3. I switched my approach to do a tried and true bar graph to visualise the
        differences between different car models.

        <br>
        For interactivity, I first gave the graph an animation for when it appears on the page.I also made it so when
        you highlight one of the segments they, will turn a darker shade and grow to distinguish from the other bars.
        Along with that, the highlighted bar will also get a bubble that shows the measurement amount indicated by the
        bar. I went with a simple blue for the visualization to make it easy to see and understand. I also made sure to
        order the bars from highest to lowest so that at a glance you can see the order.

        My first thought when creating this graph was that I wanted to compare each of the car models to see which ones
        were the most efficient in a certain category. Initially, I wanted to look at horse power but the cars with the
        highest horse power were too close together and I thought that comparing the miles per gallon would make for a
        more interesting visualization. I found from this data that Volkswagen had the most the most cars with a high
        MPG, taking up half of the top ten.
